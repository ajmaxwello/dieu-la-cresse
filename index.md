A Masonic Lodge of Leek, in the Staffordshire Moorlands of Province of Staffordshire.

This website isn’t designed to answer all the questions you may have about Freemasonry (although we’ve included links to external pages that hopefully will), but should give you the flavour of Dieu La Cresse Lodge, and why our members enjoy it so much, and why visitors to our meetings come back and take part in our social events.

## Meeting Time
Every second Monday at 18:45

## Location
Leek Masonic Hall,
King Street,
Leek.
ST13 5NY

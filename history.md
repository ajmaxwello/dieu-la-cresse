## Where Did We Get Our Name From?

For those of you who are interested, we got our name from, Dieulacres Abbey which was situated on the outskirts of Leek. It was originally established at Poulton in Cheshire, but moved to Leek in 1214

The name means, “may God increase it” which we think is very appropriate as we’re always looking for new members.

The Abbey remained in use until 1538 when it was dissolved by Henry VIII and surrendered to the Crown and its ruins are to be found within the grounds of Abbey Farm.

## A Little Bit About Dieu La Cresse Lodge

As you will have seen, we meet every second Monday in the months of September to May, inclusive.

We are a small, but friendly Lodge who will be celebrating its Centenary in 2020.

We are what is known as a daughter Lodge, which means we were originally formed from members of an existing Leek Lodge (St. Edwards Number 966) who meet at the same place, although on a different night.

Most of all we enjoy our Freemasonry and want you to do so as well.
